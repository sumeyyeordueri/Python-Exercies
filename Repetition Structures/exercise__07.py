''' Pennies for Pay

Write a program that calculates the amount of money a person would earn over a period of time if his or her salary is one penny the first day, two pennies the second day, and contin- ues to double each day. The program should ask the user for the number of days. Display a table showing what the salary was for each day, then show the total pay at the end of the period. The output should be displayed in a dollar amount, not the number of pennies. '''
