''' Distance Traveled

The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows:
distance 5 speed 3 time
For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for three hours, the distance traveled is 120 miles. Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hour) and the number of hours it has traveled. It should then use a loop to display the distance the vehicle has traveled for each hour of that time period. Here is an example of the desired output:
What is the speed of the vehicle in mph? 40 Enter How many hours has it traveled? 3 Enter
Hour         Distance Traveled
1                    40
2                    80
3                   120  '''
