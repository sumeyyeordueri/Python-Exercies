''' Sleep Debt

A “sleep debt” represents the difference between a person’s desirable and actual amount of sleep. Write a program that prompts the user to enter how many hours they slept each day over a period of seven days. Using 8 hours per day as the desirable amount of sleep, determine their sleep debt by calculating the total hours of sleep they got over the seven-day period and subtracting that from the total hours of sleep they should have got. If the user does not have a sleep debt, display a message expressing your jealousy.  '''
