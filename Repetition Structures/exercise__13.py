'''   Population

Write a program that predicts the approximate size of a population of organisms. The application should use text boxes to allow the user to enter the starting number of organ- isms, the average daily population increase (as a percentage), and the number of days the organisms will be left to multiply. For example, assume the user enters the following values:
Starting number of organisms: 2 Average daily increase: 30% Number of days to multiply: 10
The program should display the following table of data:
Day           Approximate Population
1                        2
2                        2.6
3                        3.38
4                        4.394
5                        5.7122
6                        7.42586
7                        9.653619
8                        12.5497
9                        16.31462
