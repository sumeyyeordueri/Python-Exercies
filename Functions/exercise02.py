''' String Repeater

Python allows you to repeat a string by multiplying it by an integer, e.g. 'Hi' * 3 will give 'HiHiHi'. Pretend that this feature does not exist, and instead write a function named repeat that accepts a string and an integer as arguments. The function should return a string of the original string repeated the specified number of times, e.g. repeat('Hi', 3) should return 'HiHiHi'.  '''
