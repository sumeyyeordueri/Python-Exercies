'''  Calories from Fat and Carbohydrates

A nutritionist who works for a fitness club helps members by evaluating their diets. As part of her evaluation, she asks members for the number of fat grams and carbohydrate grams that they consumed in a day. Then, she calculates the number of calories that result from the fat, using the following formula: 
calories from fat = fat grams x 9
Next, she calculates the number of calories that result from the carbohydrates, using the following formula: 
calories form carbs = carb grams x 4
The nutritionist asks you to write a program that will make these calculations.  '''
