''' Prime Numbers

A prime number is a number that is only evenly divisible by itself and 1. For example, the number 5 is prime because it can only be evenly divided by 1 and 5. The number 6, how- ever, is not prime because it can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 3, and 6.
Write a Boolean function named is_prime which takes an integer as an argument and returns true if the argument is a prime number, or false otherwise. Use the function in a program that prompts the user to enter a number then displays a message indicating whether the number is prime. '''
